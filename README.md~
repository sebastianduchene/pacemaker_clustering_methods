# Clustering methods for genomic pacemakers

This is the repository for to reproduce the code and analyses in this paper:
Duchene, Foster, and Ho. Estimating the number and assignment of clock models in analyses of multigene data sets. (Submitted)

This repository contains:

     - Empirical data sets used in the paper. These correspond to matrices in which the rows are different genes, and the columns are the branch lengths for the maximum likelihood tree topology

       - Angiosperms

       - Poaceae

       - Eudicots

       - Asteraceae

       - Rosids

       - Mammals
